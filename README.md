# Astro practice

This is a practice project for Astro and Figma. Original project repo can be found here: https://github.com/coding-in-public/desgn-landing-page

Big thanks to [@coding-in-public](https://github.com/coding-in-public) for the original project!

This repo follows the original project with some changes:

- Code updated so that it works with current Astro version (5.6). A lot of the assets are moved to the `public` folder so that Astro can serve them directly during build time.
- Javascript files are now imported from the `public` folder instead of the `src` folder and I made small fixes to Javascript code so that it works properly.
- I also downloaded most of the assets for local use so that when there are changes to Astro or to library imports, I don't have to come and fix code every time. I noticed that the original project was not working with the latest Astro version and a lot of the code was outdated and deprecated so I fixed all that.
- Blurs are a bit different and "blur2" effect is added to create slightly different effect.

Figma file image is attached to files with the file name: DSGN.png.

Mobile styles are still lacking so I'll add them later.
